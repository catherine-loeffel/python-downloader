# Python Downloader
Downloads images from urls written in a txt file

## Usage 
Run the downloader by executing the following: 
```
python python-downloader.py LINKS.txt
```
When you don't specify a text file with links the `examplelinks.txt` is taken


## Task
Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:
```
http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg
http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg
http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg
```
Write a script that takes this plaintext file as an argument and downloads all images, storing them on the local hard disk.
Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal dayâ€™s work: as if this code will be used in
important live systems, modified later on by other developers, and so on.
Please use python for your solution. We prefer to receive your code in GitHub or a similar repository.
